- GitHub :is an online hosting platform for Git repositories. It provides tools to collaborate, share code, manage issues, and handle pull requests through a web interface.

## 2.the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`.

- git pull: Fetches updates from a remote repository **and merges them automatically** into your current local branch.
- git fetch: Only downloads updates from the remote repository **without merging**. You can review the changes before deciding to merge them manually.

## 3. the purpose of `.gitignore` file?

- The `.gitignore` file tells Git which files or folders to ignore when tracking changes.
